1. PLEASE do NOT be stupid enough to use this at school! If your wifi is logged, or a teacher sees you on this they may get suspicious and report it to membean.
2. Clicking the "help" button under problems shows you the answer to the membean problems (Green=right, Red=wrong) (I really hope nobody actually needed that color explination)
3. Play around with the themes! There are a whole bunch to choose from! Find what you like!
4. Don't go too fast, from my experience teachers get sus if you do like 100 questions in 15 minutes, try to average around 40-50 questions for sessions less than 20 mins
5. GET SOME WRONG (AT LEAST 6-7), IF YOU GET ALL 100% ALL THE TIME THEY WILL CATCH ON, ESPECIALLY IF YOU WEREN'T DOING GOOD BEFORE. TRY TO GET 86%-91%!!!
6. You can use the membean site to track your session in MembeanX, and use it to see your accuracy and question number so you don't get too many right or do too many questions.
7. You'll notice there is no question timer on MembeanX, so you can take as long as you want on the questions if you actually want to learn something.
8. No, you can't take quizzes with this. You can only do your weekly minutes.
9. Try not to tell people that will get caught about this (like that one friend who keeps getting in trouble in class, or someone you know will brag about it)
10. Please don't brag to everyone about it, or everyone you see how to use it, this "tool" relies on that those who know, know; if someone else wants to use it they can find it themselves.
11. If you host it and share a link with others, PLEASE credit Bjdev, don't steal credit, it's not cool. (Especially for those who work hard to make things like this for others to use)
12. Star this if you liked it, and if you don't then WOMP WOMP.
