Bjedev made this, I am simply hosting this on vercel since the original repo's link no longer works.


Check out the original repo (By Bjdev): 
https://github.com/bjedev/MembeanX/tree/master


Making this more accesible to you guys, so you don't have to deploy it if you don't know how!


Thanks BJ <3


Enjoy!

*Something to note is that you need to know your membean login to use this, since it uses the membean site. Logging in with Google isn't an option.
